# Homework 3:

## Name: Sadman Sakib
## Matriculation Number: 7213446

## ðŸ“„ Project Description
This project is a solution for Homework3, where we extend and modify the solution from Homework2 to create a more complex class hierarchy using inheritance and polymorphism in Java.

The main features of this project include:
- Creating a superclass `Engine` with subclasses `CombustionEngine`, `ElectricEngine`, and `HybridEngine`.
- Creating a `Manufacture` class with attributes for the name and country of the manufacturer.
- Creating an abstract superclass `Vehicle` with an abstract method `ShowCharacteristics()` and subclasses `ICEV` (Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle), `BEV` (Battery Electric Vehicle), and `HybridV`.
- Demonstrating the use of inheritance and polymorphism to display characteristics of different vehicle types.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project consists of the following Java files:
- `Engine.java`: Abstract class for engine types.
- `CombustionEngine.java`, `ElectricEngine.java`, `HybridEngine.java`: Subclasses of `Engine`.
- `Manufacture.java`: Class representing a vehicle's manufacturer.
- `Vehicle.java`: Abstract superclass representing vehicles.
- `ICEV.java`, `BEV.java`, `HybridV.java`: Subclasses of `Vehicle` representing different vehicle types.
- `Main.java`: The main class to run the program and demonstrate the functionality.

## Installation

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone/Download the Project**


2. **Open the Project in Eclipse**:
   - Start Eclipse.
   - Select `File` > `Open Projects from File System...` from the menu.
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project.
   - Select the project and click `Finish` to import it into Eclipse.

## Running the Application

To run the Car Management System within Eclipse:
1. **Navigate to the `Main.java` File**:
   - In Eclipse, expand the project tree in the `Project Explorer`.
   - Find `src` > `(default package)` > `Main.java`.
2. **Run the Application**:
   - Right-click on `Main.java`.
   - Select `Run As` > `Java Application`.
   - The application will execute and create output files in the project root directory, based on the predefined filters.
